                <h1>General presentation</h1>
                <p>Nightcrawler is a 2014 American neo-noir satirical crime thriller film directed and written by Dan
                    Gilroy in his directorial debut and co-produced by and starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis "Lou"
                    Bloom, a stringer who records violent events late at night in Los Angeles and sells the footage to a
                    local television news station. The film also stars Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, and Bill Paxton. A common
                    theme in the film is the symbiotic relationship between unethical journalism and consumer
                    demand.<br>

                    Gilroy originally wanted to make a film about the life of American photographer Weegee but switched
                    focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He
                    wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a
                    pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes.
                    Filming took place over the course of four weeks and was a challenging process that included over 80
                    locations.<br>
                    It has a 7.8/10 rating on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872718/">IMDB</a>.</p>

                    <img src="photos/director.jpg" alt="" >
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Dan Gilroy was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
                        Frank D. Gilroy, and sculptor and writer Ruth Dorothy. His brother Tony Gilroy is a screenwriter
                        and director; and his fraternal twin brother, John Gilroy, is a film editor. Through his father,
                        he is of Italian, Irish and German descent.<br>

                        Gilroy wrote the script for 2005 gambling drama Two for the Money (2005), starring Al Pacino and
                        Gilroy's wife Rene Russo. His earliest credit is as co-writer of science fiction thriller
                        Freejack (1992), followed by co-writing Dennis Hopper-directed comedy Chasers. He was also one
                        of the writers to contribute to the unmade Superman film Superman Lives.<br>

                <h3>Coming up with "Nightcrawler"</h3>
                <p>Gilroy conceived the idea for Nightcrawler in 1988, after reading the photo-book Naked City, a
                    collection of photographs taken by American photographer Weegee of 1940s New York City residents at
                    night. Often lewd and sensationalized in content, Weegee would sell these photos to tabloid
                    newspapers. Intrigued by what he described as "an amazing intersection of art and crime and
                    commerce", Gilroy wrote a film treatment with a "Chinatown feel". He shelved the idea after the
                    release of The Public Eye (1992), which was loosely based on Weegee's life. Two years later, he
                    moved to Los Angeles, and noted the predominance of violent crime stories on local news stations. "I
                    suddenly became aware of and intrigued by the idea that it must be a powerful force for a TV
                    station, when they realize their ratings go through the roof when they show something with the
                    potential for violence, like a police chase", says Gilroy. Sometime later, he discovered the
                    stringer profession, and considered it to be the modern day equivalent of Weegee. Unaware of any
                    film that focused on the livelihood of stringers, he began writing a screenplay.

                    Gilroy spent several years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with
                    conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start
                    by designing the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to
                    create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt
                    antiheroes were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into
                    psychopaths; in an attempt to break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success
                    story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1982), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr.
                    Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.

                    <h3>Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Lou Bloom.<br></h3>
                    Bloom is a grubby small time criminal with no moral fiber at all. Although he is intended to be an
                    anti-hero it is hard to see him in any type of heroic light at all. He loves filming criminal
                    activity; he feels comfortable amongst the criminal element and will stop at nothing to get what he
                    wants.<br>

                    Nina is a hard-nosed journalist who runs the newsroom and wants to make sure that her channel stays
                    one step ahead of the other networks when it comes to giving viewers what they want. She also knows
                    that viewers want the shocking, the salacious and the downright voyeuristic, because every time she
                    features this her ratings go up. She also knows that crime against affluent people gets far more
                    attention than crime against residents of Los Angeles' more disadvantaged areas. Nina has no line to
                    cross when it comes to getting a story. There is nothing she believes off limits.<br>

                    Lou down for a raise, using what he knows about the way in which he gets his stories as
                    leverage.<br>

                <h1> Resume</h1>
                <p>Petty thief Louis "Lou" Bloom is caught stealing from a Los Angeles railyard by a security guard. He
                    attacks the guard, steals his watch and leaves with stolen material. After selling the material at a
                    scrap yard, Lou asks for a job, but the foreman says he does not hire thieves. While driving home,
                    Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two
                    police officers pulling a woman from the burning wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder, tells Lou
                    that they sell their footage to local news stations.

                    Inspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two
                    unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and
                    sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director, Nina Romina, tells him the station is
                    especially interested in footage of "graphic" accidents and violent crime in affluent, White areas.
                    Lou hires an assistant, Rick, a young homeless man desperate for money. To give his footage more
                    impact, Lou tampers with crime scenes, in one case moving a body to get a better camera angle. As
                    Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.

                    Lou pressures Nina into a date, telling her he knows she is desperate for higher ratings. On their
                    date, he threatens to terminate his business with Nina unless she has sex with him, and it is
                    implied that she acquiesces. Lou turns down an offer to work for Joe, but when Joe beats him to an
                    important plane crash story, Nina demands that Lou get better footage and keep his end of their
                    bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou
                    records the aftermath.

                    Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police at the site of a triple-homicide home invasion in
                    Granada Hills. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the
                    house and later presents footage to the station with the perpetrators edited out. The news staff
                    frets over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands
                    public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri shows up at Lou's apartment to question him
                    about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the incident, cutting out
                    the parts with the gunmen.

                    That night, Lou and Rick track down the driver to his house, staking out the house until he leaves
                    to pick up his partner. Lou wants to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police
                    and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make,
                    threatening to tell the police about Lou's withholding of evidence; Lou agrees.

                    When the gunmen stop at a restaurant, Lou phones the police, warning them that the suspects are
                    armed. They arrive and exchange gunfire. A police officer is shot and one of the killers is gunned
                    down while the other manages to escape in the SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing
                    and recording, culminating in a long multiple-car collision.

                <h4> Ending</h4>
                After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou approaches the vehicle, claiming that the gunman is dead and urging
                Rick to film him. The gunman is revealed to be alive as he shoots Rick, flees, and is killed by arriving
                police officers. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who
                successfully extorted him for withholding evidence, because he knows it will happen again.

                Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the
                home invasion was actually the criminals breaking in to steal cocaine that the homeowners were stashing;
                Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate Lou's
                footage as evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it and airs it immediately. Lou voluntarily
                speaks with Detective Frontieri. While being interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates a story about the
                men in the SUV following him; Frontieri knows he is lying, but cannot prove it. Later, Lou hires a team
                of interns to expand his business, saying that he will not ask them to do anything he is unwilling to do
                himself.

                <h1> Commentary</h1>
                Nightcrawler is a scathing critique of capitalism and shows how the effects of a struggling economy
                trickle down to the individual. When people like Lou need money to survive and are unable to find jobs,
                they are left to their own devices, and often make immoral decisions in pursuit of financial success.
                The film’s indictment of capitalism is broad, but the world of local television news is specific, and
                Gilroy offers provocative commentary on the creation and consumption of news in 21st century America. A
                number of critics have complained that the points made here are too shallow and simplistic, pointing out
                that we’ve seen this story before in films like Network (1976), The King of Comedy (1982), and To Die
                For (1995). This may be true, but Nightcrawler is a powerful reminder that the situation has only gotten
                worse.

                The purpose of local television news has always been to provide viewers with information about their
                community. In order to succeed, local news stations must report unique stories that cannot be gleaned
                from nationally syndicated news outlets. This typically involves stories about local crime, and as
                Nightcrawler illustrates, gruesome murders in affluent neighborhoods garner the highest ratings. Many of
                us already know this, but Nightcrawler takes it a step further by showing us how local news operates
                when crime rates have dropped. This dearth of violence means there will be a frantic fight to be the
                first on the scene when a crime does occur; furthermore, in Lou’s case, there will also be fabrication
                in order to make the scene more dramatic.

                This is what separates Nightcrawler from the aforementioned thematic predecessors, as well as what makes
                it an urgent exposé of our times.
